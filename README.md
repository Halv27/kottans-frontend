I had never studied information about Git та GitHub before, so everything was completely new to me. Frankly speaking, it was not very easy and took some time to understand and I think I will need to improve my knowledge to use it effectively in the future but practicing will help.


#### 2. Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools

<summary> Linux </summary>

I had minimal experience working with the command line, that is, I used the most basic commands and nothing more. So, most of the information was new to me. I discovered that doing some things in the command line is faster to do than using the touchpad. 


#### 3. VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration

As I have already written, Git and Github were completely new to me. This part of the course was quite difficult for me and I spent quite a lot of time to complete it and in order to understand some things, I watched and read additional information. Also I first went through the entire course on the Coursera 'Introduction to Git and GitHub' and only then sent the pull request and I think that this helped to make it. 


### Front-End Basics

#### Intro to HTML & CSS

Information about CSS and HTML wasn't new to me so there was no problem to quickly pass these courses, moreover, they mostly cover basic things I've already known. But I think it was still useful to repeat the things mentioned in these courses to consolidate my knowledge. Еor example, I refreshed the information about the attribute selector. In fact, for some reason, I rarely used it, maybe in the future I will fix it.
