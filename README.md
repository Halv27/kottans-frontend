[PR](https://github.com/kottans/mock-repo/pull/910)

</details>

*I had never studied information about Git та GitHub and I had never used them before, so everything was completely new to me. Frankly speaking, it was not very easy and took some time to understand. I think I will need to improve my knowledge to use it effectively in the future, but I hope practicing will help.*

*Speaking about the pull-request, I just have to say that it was my first PR in my life. I spent like a day trying to figure out how to send it.
And I have to say that it's not as scary as it seemed at first)))*

*I had minimal experience working with the command line. I mean I used the most basic commands and nothing more. So, most of the information was new to me. I discovered that doing some things in the command line is faster to do than using the touchpad. Also, I'd never have thought that the terminal could print files, although I don't think I'll use it in the future. This is very unusual.*

*As I have already written, Git and Github were completely new to me. This part of the course was quite difficult for me and I spent a lot of time completing it. In order to understand some things, I watched and read additional information. I really wanted to understand how to work with Git and Github. Some of the levels from Learngitbranching.js.org were sufficiently intricate for me and, despite the fact I did all the tasks, I will hardly be able to repeat some commands without outside help (or I will spend a lot of time).*

*Also, I first went through the entire course on the Coursera 'Introduction to Git and GitHub' and only then sent the pull request and I think this somehow helped to create it.*

*Information about CSS and HTML wasn't new for me so there was no problem to quickly pass these courses, moreover, they mostly cover basic things I've already known. But I think it was still useful to repeat the things mentioned in these courses to consolidate my knowledge. For example, I refreshed the information about the attribute selector. In fact, for some reason, I rarely used it, maybe in the future I will fix this because sometimes it is a very useful thing.* 


#### 4. Responsive Web Design

<details>
<summary> Responsive web design basics </summary>
</br>
Most of the information that was given in the article was familiar to me, but there were things that I didn’t know. 

It was useful to read how to solve the problem of the scrollbar appearing when the image has fixed dimensions and if it is larger than the viewing window. A common way to deal with this problem is to give all images a max-width of 100%. But as it was written, it is generally safer to add the following to the stylesheet:
    
>img {
  max-width: 100%;
  display: block;
}
    
Also, it was mentioned it’s better to still use the width and height attributes on the <img> tag. This is because modern browsers will use this information to reserve space for the image before it loads in. This will help to avoid layout shifts as content loads.

<summary> FLEXBOX. Вчимося верстати на флексах </summary>
</br>
I really like Zhenia's videos and how he explains. I discovered a lot of useful information for myself after watching his videos. Also It's very cool he gave his cheat sheet about Flexbox features and practice tasks to consolidate the material for his viewers.

These features I studied: flex-basis, flex-grow, flex-shink, flex etc. 
Also, I will take into account how to place the footer at the bottom of the page, stretching the main part to the entire free space of the page (if we use Flexbox). In this case, our footer always is at the bottom of the page, even if there is little content in the main part:
>.block__row {
display:flex;
flex-direction: column;
}</br>
.block__column—2 {
flex: 1 1 auto;
}

Interesting was the speaker's decision to indent between 2 columns (total indent 16 pixels) using such properties:
>.columns__row {
display:flex;
display-wrap: wrap;
margin: 0px -8px;
}</br>
.columns__column {
padding: 0px 8px;
flex: 0 1 50%; 
}   
    
I think most of what was mentioned in the video I will use in the future.

<summary> Flexbox Froggy </summary>

It's a cool game to remember Flexbox. I've played it before, but I also liked it this time.

It was a quite useful game to establish the basic Grid's properties. I've played it before, and it was fun to do it again.
